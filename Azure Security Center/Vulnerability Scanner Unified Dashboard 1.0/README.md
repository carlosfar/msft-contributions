This Workbook provides an unified view on the information collected by the the following recommendations from Azure Security Center:
- Vulnerabilities in your **virtual machines** should be remediated
- Vulnerabilities in **Azure Container Registry images** should be remediated (powered by Qualys)
- Vulnerability assessment findings on your **SQL servers** on machines should be remediated

The second row provides high level summary in the form of a pie chart representing the severities found for each workload type (Servers , Azure Container Registries and SQL Servers) of the number of vulnerabilities.
In the third row we are providing a table with each resource assessed (clicking on the resource link will redirect you to the resource itself) with a summary of the number of vulnerabilities per severity for each resource. |
